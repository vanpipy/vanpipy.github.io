# What is the OpenAPI Specification
> The OpenAPI Specification allows the description of a remote API accessible through HTTP or HTTP-like protocols.

## [What Is an API?](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/introduction.html#what-is-an-api)
> An Application Programming Interface (API) defines the allowed interactions between two pieces of software, just like a User Interface defines the ways in which a user can interact with a program.

## [API Definition Through Documentation](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/introduction.html#api-definition-through-documentation)
> APIs are typically accompanied by a reference guide; a piece of literature explaining to a developer how to use the API.

## [API Definition Through a Description File](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/introduction.html#api-definition-through-a-description-file)
> An API description file (sometimes called Contract) is a machine-readable specification of an API. It should strive to be as complete, and fully-detailed as possible, although absolute completeness is not usually a requirement. Also, just like legal contracts, the more unambiguous it is, the more useful it becomes.

## [The OpenAPI Specification](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/introduction.html#the-openapi-specification)
> The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a vendor neutral description format for HTTP-based remote APIs. It was originally based on the Swagger 2.0 Specification, donated by SmartBear Software in 2015.

## [A Brief Historical Comparison](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/introduction.html#a-brief-historical-comparison)
> _Machine-readable API descriptions are not a new thing_, they have been present in local APIs for a long time: For instance, C has method signatures and higher-level languages like Java or C# have Interface definitions. The remote API descriptions shown in this page serve exactly the same purpose and this section should make it clearer what this purpose is to readers more familiar with traditional local APIs.

## [The OpenAPI Specification Explained](https://oai.github.io/Documentation/specification.html)
> The OpenAPI Specification is the ultimate source of knowledge regarding this API description format. However, its length is daunting to newcomers and makes it hard for experienced users to find specific bits of information. This chapter provides a soft landing for readers not yet familiar with OpenAPI and is organized by topic, simplifying browsing.
