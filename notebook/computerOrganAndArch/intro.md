# Top-Down Approach - Structure And Function

A computer is a complex system; contemporary computers contain millions of elementary electronic components, How, then, can one clearly describe them? The key is to recoginize the hierarchical nature of most complex systems, including the computer. A hierachical system is a set of interrelated subsystems, each of the latter, in turn, hierachical in structure until we reach some lowest level of elementary subsystems.

The hierarchical nature of complex systems is essential to both their design and their description. The designer need only deal with a particular level of the system at a time. At each level, the system consists of a set of components and their interrelationships. The behavior at each level depends only on a simplified, abstracted characterization of the system at the next lower level. At each level, the designer is concerned with structure and function:

* Structure: The way in which the components are interrelated.
* Function: The operation of each individual component as part of the structure.

In term of description, we have two choices: starting at the bottom and building up to a complete description, or beginning with a top view and decomposing the system into its subparts. Evidence from a number of fields suggests that the top-down approach is the clearest and most effective.
