A General Flow Chart

1. Ideaing
    * define a problem(if no problem)
        - A precise problem is very valuable
    * try to solve the problem or find a way to reach it
2. Concept
    * Generate numerous models or diagram to descibe
    * Detailed requirements
3. Planning
    * There are three needed parts:
        + Budget
            - any resource is needed
        + Task
            - decompose the concept to smaller task
        + People
            - find the suitable person and assign the task to the person
4. Design
    * Lots of things need you
        - budget, task, people(yep, all of things in planing phase)
    * A great or better road to meet the requirements
5. Development
    * As we know, developing something is generating a result called a product
6. Launch
    * The product is running
7. Review
    * summarize all of details above to descibe what happened
    * optimize the method
